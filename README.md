# ADB.py

#### *A Python wrapper for ADB commands (backup/restore)*

---

This script is a wrapper for the Android ADB suite of commands. As of right now, only adb backup and adb restore are included, and it's very barebones...and also built specifically for my PC.

---

#### TODO:

* Backup management

  * Move backups to folder and rename with backup date
  * When "restore" is chosen, rename backup to "backup.ab" and restore (if necessary...haven't tested)
  * Backup retention
